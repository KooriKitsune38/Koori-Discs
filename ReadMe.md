# Readme
## Get the disc
Nothing, just get the disk with:
`/give @s minecraft:music_disc_13{SongID:1,k.Disc:true}`

## Adding Discs
To add discs, go to `data/k.music/functions/sort.ids` and copy the commented lines.

After that you can just add the custom sound to the first line you added, and repeat the same sound to the second.
